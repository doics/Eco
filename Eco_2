Special Drawing rights (by IMf 1969)
-Definition: This is a kind of reserve of foreign exchange assets comprising leading currencies globally and created by the International Monetary Fund in the year 1969. 

Description: Before its creation, the international community had to face several restrictions in increasing world trade and the level of financial development as gold and US dollars, which were the only means of trade, were in limited quantities. In order to address the issue, SDR was created by the IMF. 

SDR is often regarded as a 'basket of national currencies' comprising four major currencies of the world - US dollar, Euro, British Pound and Yen (Japan). The composition of this basket of currencies is reviewed every five years wherein the weightage of currencies sometimes get altered.

-while calculating SDR dominance in international trade and domestic foreign reserve is taken into account
-SDR mainly concern with only IMF operations.
-China is pushing to add Renminbi’s inclusion into the Special Drawing Right (SDR) as one of its reserve currency

why china want
-inclusion will symbolize the recognition of China's growing global stature

why it should be added
-Countries around the world have become increasingly reliant on China as a trade partner
-Huge foreign reserve
-manufacturing powerhouse of the world
-China accounted for one-third to half of global imports of ores, oil seeds and grains, wood and copper in 2012.

benefits to world
-will lead to diversification of currencies and as the investment capacity of China is increasing the inclusion will lead to more investible currency for countries and will benefit the entire world economy
-inclusion can lead to increase in growth rate of world economy

Apprehensions
-controlled-economy of China and fixed exchange rate followed by China.
-Though China is moving towards liberalising its financial market and capital convertibility. Pace of these reform is good but have not achieved full objectives as yet
-will make China more bold to go hard after its increasing global clout.
-can be countered by US and japan which have reservation with chinese aggresive stand.

for India
- India will benefit from the inclusion of Chinese Renminbi. As a part of BRICS initiative of contingency reserve fund
-

reservations
-growth of china is alarming for India as far as regional politics of South Asia and question of getting permanent seat in UNSC is concerned.
-China can leverage its clout to benfit pak.
- India have large trade deficit with china. If india able to compensate this deficit with china though Tertiary and secondary sector. Then india can gain from it
-India's share in IMF is only 2.75. If india able to stabalise it;s currency value against hot currency of world by increasing invisible trade . it can benefited

Outflowing FDI by indian corporates
-HAve both good and bad effects

Positives
-return on that investment ultimately comes to us
-brand building
-increasing political clout
-Energy security like Adani investing in Australia minning
-Helps our companies to go global and generate in house jobs also
Negatives
-country money go out
-Rupee is converted to dollar so rupee depreciates
-most of the jobs are created at destination

Reasons for outflow
-Nascent sectors such as agriculture,food processing, services in developing countries provide low competition and high returns.
-Unexploited mining resources in foreign nation,like in africa
-Case of pride and prestige like infy opening its campus outside
-Most of outward FDI has been manufacturing and services with main route being mergers and acquisition in developed 
-Indian companies feel that they need to acquire foreign competitors in order to learn from their technology 
- Difficulty in ease of doing business , red tape,unstable tax regime, high service tax,difficulty in clearance


India Recent GDP growth
-India’s economic growth rate will surpass that of the China's, both this year
and the next year too
-current 7.2 will pick up to 7.5 in 2015 and 2016
-china to slip down from current 7.4 to 6.8 in 15 and 6.3 in 16
+ve
-Moody upgraded rating to stable (2015)
-Investment sentiment improving
-Make in India pitch gooding good
-RBI reducing rate so more financial availablbiility
-Inflation is under control. more elbow space for liberalized monetary policy
Not to rejoice
-China is $10T we are mere $2T
-China huge foreign reserve
-Strong manufacturing hub and indigenous defence sector
-very less dependent on import to buffer from currency fluctuation.
-Shoot in crude price might hurt our growth
-Monsoon dependent economy of ours
-CHina compund grwoth rate bw1990-2013 was over 10% our one time best was 9
-China per capita income is $3500 ours is 1/3 of it.
-China GDP saving is 51% ours is mere 30%
-China has full electricity coverage our around quarter don't have electricity
-China literacy rate is 95 ours is 74
-China eco coult as depicted by its control on AIIB , SCO , 
-relation with other countries even with our neighbours like pak , SL 
-Maritime silk route if goes well will boos chinese economy


In future india more like Mexico not china
-China has invested large physical capital in manufacturing while India’s low productivity manufacturing sector is full of small size firms.Mexico too have small size firm driven manufacturing.share of MSMEs in manufacturing employment is 84% in India versus 24.8% for China.
-Both Mexico and India have a demographic advantage, at least for the next 20 years. 
-Democracy in India and Mexico, in contrast with Communist rule in China so no iron fist control on labour
-Public spending on infrastructure in Mexico and India is far behind that in China.

-steps to meet china pace
-labour reforms + Success of make in India
-ease of doing business,check on bureaucratic hurdles
-reform of bankruptcy laws
-better investment on skills and infra


2008 eco trends vis a vis india and china growth
general
---India remained service sector intensive economy whereas China dominated by manufacturing.
-India working on to increase saving rates , china working to accelerate it to make economy ressilient
---------------------
-both followed different approaches for growth. Indian growth story was led by domestic consumption,
china’s economy was fuelled by export.but it changed post 2008
similarity
-Both were less efected by 2008 crisis compared to western nations
-Reason for same was huge domestic market in both.
growth trends
-both resorted to fiscal stimulus to revive the economy and reduce the impact of crisis 
-China was more impacted than India due to its heavy reliance on export
-Increasing labour rate in chaina effected its manufacturing
-China reoriented its economy to stimulate domestic demand. These included encouraging consumption spending by reducing retail interest rates, incentivising housing sector and diversifying industrial sector
-India also focused on diversification of its export market. The export to non-traditional region like Asia, Africa and Latin America was encouraged
-China explored alternative ways to utilize its excess industrial capital and huge
foreign exchange reserve though setting up institutions like AIIB and One Belt One Road initiatives.





Reason for jobless growth in 2 decades
-Service sector oriented growth -> don't cater to unskilled labour which is huge in number.
-Less evolved industry sector
-Disguised employment in agriculture
-Stagnation in Services due to shortage of skilled labour
-Failure to leverage modern  R&D
-Lack of entrepreneurship culture
-Small scale operations of MSME (as MSME big contributor to GDP)
-Health and education
-Migration from agricultural sector could not be absorbed by manufacturing and service 
sector due to lack of skills.



Low inflation in India due to Crude , agriculture and Inflation expectations
->with trageted inflation policy there has ben easing in inflation which is expected to continue due to:
1.Crude - low price will persist coz
-Low demand due to global slowdown 
-High production due to shale gas discovery in low
-Low interest in US with fed expected to increase that in future.(high interest so less funds available 
to oil company so they are now taking loans and investing in oil extraction so more production now)
2.Agri
-Decline in global agree market so less agree prices, likely to have a impact in moderating increases in 
domestic support prices.
-Rural wage growth will de accelerate so will moderate inflation.
3.	Inflation expectations:
•	India’s inflation will be shaped by pressures from foreign and domestic agriculture
•	Economy will over-perform on inflation and lead to monetary easing
•	Declining bond yields could lead to reduction in lending rates by banks
However PIGS and EU crisis migh impact food price.

MAT [Minimum alternate TAx]
- for taxes that the government lost out on owing to multiple exemptions granted to various interest groups.
-It was seen earlier that some companies were not paying any tax inspite of earning huge profits and paying hefty dividends to their shareholders due to different exemptions available for them under Indian IT Act 1961.
-rate 18.5% + cess
-if the income tax payable by any company on its “taxable income” under the normal provisions of the income tax act is less than 18.5% of its book profits, then the company needs to pay Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) at 18.5%
-This tax is to be paid even if the companies’ tax liability is lower than the tax rate of 18.5%, owing to tax incentives and deductions availed by the company.
MAT notice to Foreign Portfolio investors by Income tax department
-MAT is generally applicable to domestic and foreign companies having a 'place of business in India' 
that are required to draw up a balance sheet and a profit and loss account for
-two judgements passed by the Authority for Advanced Rulings (AAR), one in 2010 and another in 2012
-the former exempted foreign investors from MAT, the latter made MAT applicable to both domestic and foreign investors
-So income tax departmetn issued notice to 68 FPIs on their profit made that too retrospectively
-Indian tax laws allow such notices and assessments to be issued for up to seven previous years.
-FPI's argument
1>Since they don't have place of business in India and so are not required to maintain account books in India  so MAT shouldn't be levied on them
2- MAT is a levy of tax to neutralize the effect of tax incentives, which the FPIs are unlikely to claim
3. These companies may not be able to claim credit of MAT in their home country and hence the MAT burden weighs heavily on their profits
4. Most FIIs say that they have already distributed profits of prior years to investor so practically impossible to get that money back to pay the tax.
5. ARR 2010 judgement says it can't be lived on FPI not having place of business in India.
Problem to India economy
-FPI in panic started taking out money from indian market -> low rupee -> crude import costly
-panic in stock market and big fall in sensex and nifty
-might scare foreign investor which are very much required for many sectors
-give -ve image of india and shoody tax structures abroad.might impact make in India
other problem:
 -fund takeover by AMCs/investors (who held units for less than a year) and merger of 
 schemes run by one fund house suffered capital gain tax as process treated as redemption
 -short term capital gain of 15% levid even if unit not redeemed 
Budget 2015 provisions.
 -proposed to amend the relevant sections so as to specifically "provide that income from 
 transactions in securities  (other than short term capital gains arising on transactions on 
 which securities transaction tax is not chargeable) arising to an FII, shall be excluded from 
 the chargeability of MAT...But it will be effective from 1 april 2015.
 - tax ‘neutrality’ as takeover by AMCs and merger of schemes run by one fund house with another 
 is not treated as redemption, and hence does not attract short-term capital gains.

Medium term economic framework(MTEF) was suggested under FRBM Act for better fiscal management and fiscal discipline in the country
MTEF is a whole-of-government strategic policy & expenditure framework which balances what is affordable against policy priorities of the government.
An MTEF consists of:
¾ Top-down resource envelop
¾ A bottom-up estimation of current & medium-term (usually a 3-5 year period) costs of existing policies
¾ Matching these costs with available resources. This should take place in the context of annual budget process

This is necessary in Indian context to correct the multiplicity of problems in india’s fiscal budgeting :
1.	MTEF will shift the psychology of budgeting from “needs” to an “availability of resources”
2.	improved economic growth: Rational approach to retrenchment and economic stabilization
3.	Improve the impact of government policy 
a.	Better allocation of resources to strategic priorities between and within sectors
b.	Greater predictability of both policy and funding
4.	Improve Program Performance and Impact 
a.	Shift bureaucracy from ‘administrative’ to ‘managerial’ culture 
b.	Greater room for managerial flexibility and innovation
6. Will help to avoid March rush spending.
-will provide a strategic and accountable platform with which to undertake integrated budgeting.
-Will help to do away with plan and non plan expenditure (?)

However only working on MTEF will not completely address problems of Fiscal deficit. An integrated approach and proper implementation of FRBM Act is crucial to fiscal sustainability and creation of fiscal space



Ministry of Finance
-Deails with following
-taxation
-financial legislation
-international borrowing
-Budget foarmation and economic survey
-centre and state finances
-financial institutions
-Capital market
-deals with mainly pre-sanction appraisal of various schemes, handling Centre budgetary resources transferred to States etc
->Reforms required
-According the 2dn ARC, in terms of budgetary process, weakness like unrealistic budget estimates as due to frequent revision and unspent
provisions, delays in project implementation, no correlation between expenditure and actual implementation etc.
-To avoid these, the assumptions made while formulating estimates must be realistic, replacing by a ‘top-down’ method by indicating aggregate limits to expenditure to each organization/agency, Internal capacity for making realistic estimates needs to be developed.
- need to make social schemes to be transfer to Post offices to lower PSB burdens
-The practice of announcing projects and schemes on an ad-hoc basis in budgets and on important National Days, and during visits of dignitaries’ functionaries to States needs to be stopped.Essential scheme can be considered in annual plan
-proper check of insider trading by SEBI and watching the commodity market is also need of the hour too.
-Other recommendation for Audit, for expenditure, revenues etc. needs to be implemented


PC dead what is effect
-in consultation with the finance ministry it fixed annual gross budgetary support (GBS) for central and state Plans,GBS ceiling decided after state consultation and PM sign off
-the Planning Commission negotiated state-wise allocations of resources for different centrally sponsored schemes (CSS).these allocations were proposed by line ministries based on their own assessments of fiscal need, the planning commission was allegedly able to take a cross-sectoral view

criticism of above
-absurdly irrelevant distinction between Plan and non-Plan expenditure, 
-disempowering line ministries as PC can veto their proposal of allcoation, 
- allowing the Centre room to meddle in fiscal matters best left to states by overdesigning and micromanaging the criteria for allocating resources to CSS

aftermath of scrapping planning commission
-finance ministry continues to operate a fragmented, annualised budgeting process rather than going for medium term economic framework(MTEF) as suggested in FRMA act 2003.
-accounting exercise continues to be the focus of attention at the expense of strategic imperatives. The latest circular signals that this will continue through to the presentation of the third Union Budget of this government
-finance ministry will continue to operate the antiquarian and irrelevant Plan/non-Plan distinction
-The old process of negotiation with states mediated by the PM will be replaced by finance ministry bureaucratic fiat.
-finance ministry will continue to set annual revenue "targets" instead of assessing the medium-term potential for revenue mobilisation based on the expected GDP growth rate, tax rates and buoyancies.
-Pressure to meet revenue targets will increase the incentive to be adversarial
-medium term statements presented in the Budget will continue to be add-ons with zero operational or policy relevance
-by continuing with plan/non plan distinction it will not be accountable for fiscal consolidation and  value for money.
-life would become much easier for the finance ministry because the "to and fro on the GBS was finalised after mediation from the prime minister. This is likely to be avoided this year as the amount can be decided by the PM based on discussions with the finance ministry alone
-this will disempowers the line ministries, whose control over allocations to CSS will be second guessed, even vetoed, by finance ministry bureaucrats.


1967 economy policy

Why
-war with pak
-west pressure for liberalization ,
-Rupee devaluation and inflation
What whas these
-Nationalisation of all banks to secure credit line
- coal industry and insurance nationalized
-Monopolies and Restrictive Trafe Practices Act was passed which curtailed big businesses
-sectors were kept reserved for small sclae industries so as to help employment
-Many sick units were taken over by the State
-Green revolution
-Foreign currency restriction through FERA
-License quota was introduced to check capitalist acrivities and it actually put a check on production, prices and expansion.
effects
-some positive impact initial ,economic and social indicator improved
-industrial base was widened with aim at maximising welfare.
-but later negative effect and finally 1991 crisis -> LPG


India BPL identification methods
-1990 ->Lakdawala committee 
-egional economic differences are large enough that poverty lines should be calculated for each state
- a standard list of commodities were drawn up and priced in each state of the nation, using 1973–74 as a base year.
-This basket of goods could then be re-priced each year and comparisons made between regions
-2,400 kcal in rural areas and slightly less than 2,100 kcal in urban areas 


2000(Saxena Committee report)
-using data over 1972 to 2000, separated calorific intake apart from nominal income in its economic analysis of poverty
-stated that 50% of Indians lived below the poverty line (Planning commission said it at 39)


Suresh Tendulkar Committ(2011-12)
-Rs 27 in rural areas and Rs 33 in urban
-wider definition, including spending on food[calorific value] as well as education, health, light(electricity), clothing and footwear.
-earlier method used to consider money required to take only minimum required calories.


RangaRajan Committee (2014)
-Rs 32 in villages, Rs 47 in cities. (4860,7035 - family of 5 per month)
-29.5% of the India population lives below the poverty line[in 2011-12]
-based on purchasing power parity terms. The minimum expenditure per day.
-used nutrition, spending and consumption behaviour
-It not only takes normative levels for adequate nourishment, clothing, house rent, conveyance and education, but also considers behaviourally-determined levels of other non-food expenses.
-computed the average requirements of calories, proteins and fats on the norms set by the Indian Council for Medical Research in 2010


World bank (2014)
-The new method proposes setting poverty line at $1.78 per day on 2011 PPP basis




PSL
-Increasing the PSL targets of foreign banks  to 40% (earlier 32%)with sub-targets being applicable for banks having more than 20 branches. Further, they have been given a 5 year timeline to achieve the targets.
* Doing away of the direct-indirect classification and with specific targets for of 8% for small and marginal farmers and 8% for micro units and 10% for weaker sections.However, this move may adversely affect the loans to medium and large farmers as the banks may be inclined to disburse loans to indirect agriculture activities who are more credit-worthy.
* inclusion of loans to sectors such as social infrastructure, renewable energy and medium enterprises etc.  Further, the included sectors are in-line with the emerging priorities.
issue
-already high NPA
-issues for smaller bank in meeting the targets.
-lending to micro sector under psl might collide with MUDRA bank.
+ve -it makes it hard for banks to miscalculate under sectoral lending.

Public debt /Fiscal deficit
-when expenditure > receipts
-two methods internal borrowing or external borrowing
=Internal borrowing
-government securities,
- treasury bills,
-post office savings certificates and 
-national saving certificates.
=External borrowings
-intl bond market
-intl insti like WB or IMF
-foreign countries
-Currently, the main objectives of public debt management in India are:
(1) Meeting the Central Government’s financing needs at the lowest possible long term borrowing costs;
(2) Keeping the total debt within sustainable levels;
(3) Placing reliance on domestic borrowings over external debt; and
(4) Developing deep and wide market for Government securitie

-Reserve Bank of India Act, empowers the RBI to manages the public debt incurred internally by way of securities, treasury bills and cash management bills
-external done by central govt through finance ministry
-Ve
-There is conflict of interest of RBI with being debt manager and monetary policy manager.
-this strategy of the debt management results in fragmented jurisdiction of the management institutions,
-comprehensive picture of govt liability missing
So FSLRC has proposed the setting up of an independent Public Debt Management Authority to take over from the RBI the management of public debt.it relive RBI as internal debt manager of govt as it can conflict with its inflation management mandate. 
Arguments against a PDMA
1) There is no conflict of interest as the FRBM act prohibits trading of securities by RBI.
2) Numerous agencies will lead to poor coordination and conflicts.
3) Independence of such a body is questionable.
4) The present system has certain synergies. It has done well all these years. RBI with its enormous market data can better handle public debt.
5) International studies have shown that public debt lies at the junction of monetary and fiscal policies and not independent of them.
6) PDMA in Greece or other nations have not prevented the huge debts of these countries.
7)denmark and ireland where it has been transferred back to central bank.


Relation between Government Debt and Deficit
when govt spends more than it collects by way of revenue,it incures deficit.when the govt incurred revenue deficit,it implies that govt ud dissaving and is using the savings of other sctores of economy to finance a part of its condumption expenditure.this means that govt have to borrow to finance its investment and consumption expenditure.this leads to building up of debts 
Government Debt is the currency composition of debt i.e. US denominated Indian rupee, Japanese Yen, SDR and EURO. Government debt as a percent of GDP is used by investors to measure a country ability to make future payments on its debt, thus affecting the country borrowing costs and government bond yields.



Small finaincial bank revolutionary why?
-Suggested by Nachiket mor committee on Financial inclusion.

-Will fulfil the dream of one person one bank account.
-Increase banking infra in rural area
-will increase compitition -> Decrease banking cost
-Unorganized sector will benefit a lot -> coz current PSL is there but some banks esp private one preffer given loan to effulent sections in PSL sectors
-Unorganized sector loan is not core constinuency of commercial bank
-will take care of RRB shortcoming as most of them will be privately owned to more efficency and performance linked incentive to executive
-it gives a chance to MFI to cater to wider audience and they can use their expertise in MFI lending to put a whole new face of beneficiary banking
-Can act at e governance centre at rural area as they will already have required infra
-have capability of taking JAM trinity to next level and help to operanalize DBT on large scale.

Indardhanush

In the past few years Public Sector Banks (PSBs) have been struggling to deal with - (A) low profitability and (B) high non-performing assets (NPAs). It is against this background that the government seeks to revive PSBs and their performance with Indradhanush. The following are the seven main concerns that Indradhanush seeks to address

(A) Recapitalisation - Infusion of Rs 25,000 crore of capital in debt-laden banks.
(B) Appointments - Keeping in mind global best practices, the post of Chairman and Managing Director are to be seperated and there would be another person who would be appointed as non Executive Chairman of PSBs.
(C) Banks Board Bureau (BBB) - Bank governance the exiting Appointments Board is sought to be replaced by a BBB, which will be tasked with appointment of chairpersons and directors, besides guiding PSBs on matters of strategy.
(D) Governance - Regular Gyan Sangams, i.e., conclave of PSBs and financial institutions has been proposed to discuss the process of governance reforms
(E) Bad loans - NPAs burden of PSBs is sought to be addressed by way of developing vibrant debt markets for PSBs besides strengthening of asset restructuring companies and addressing the issues of stalled projects. 
(F) Empowerment - In this regard, banks have been assured that government will not interfere with their functioning besides allowing them flexibility in hiring manpower. 
(G) Accountability - A new framework - Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) has been proposed to measure the performance of PSBs.

While, the objectives of the Indradhanush initiative appear promising and its proposals welcome, some concerns remain:
(A) Critics argue that periodic bailout are akin to flushing money down the drain. Instead, they propose that recapitalisation must be strictly performance based.
(B) Given that the BBB will continue to have government nominees on board, it is nothing but a rechristened form of the exiting "Appointment Board". BBB could continue to face government interference in matters of appointments resulting in the casualty of merit.
(C) P J Nayak committee's recommendation regarding the setting up of a Bank Investment Company run entirely by professions, to which the government’s equity stakes in PSBs would be transferred, has largely been ignored.
(D) The Nayak Committee proposal on parity of practices between private and public banks has also been ignored like chiarman profit based salary, removing from CVC,RTI and CAG ambit,bailout of loan and other ,removing compulsion of reinvesting in GSEC
(E) The measures in relation to NPAs are nothing but a reiteration of the existing measures being taken by the RBI and government in this regard.

Imp Note: PJ Nayak committee [Ex chairmna Axis bank] on bank board governance.
-RBI setup this Committee to review the governance of Board of Banks in India. (Published in May 2014)

Gist of the matter?

-In Sarkaari banks, Government owns >50% shares.Therefore Government has majority voting power.
-So, it can appoint (inefficient but ustaad-in-chamchaagiri) type people as board directors and CMDs as per its own whims and fancies. 
-Result: Scams like syndicate bank, and overall inefficiency.
-Nayak says Government should transfer its shares to Bank investment Company (BIC), with functional autonomy.  (Then Government won’t be able to appoint directors as per its own whims and fancies) thus Sarkaari bank’s “Governance” will improve.

Reform #1: Repeal laws
Nayak recommends Government to repeal following laws

-Bank nationalization Act (1970, 1980)
-SBI Act, SBI subsidiaries Act
Because above acts require Government to keep shareholding >50%, and appoints CMDs and board directors. Once these acts are repealed.

->Reform #2: Bank Investment Company

Step1: Government should setup a Bank Investment Company (BIC), under Companies act, 2013. As a “Core investment company”.
Step2: Government should transfer its shares of Sarkaari banks, to BIC.
Step3: Register all Sarkaari banks as ‘subsidiary companies’ of BIC, under Companies act.  (Because now BIC owns >50% shares in those company, so BIC is the parent “Holding” company and those banks became BIC’s subsidiary companies).
consequently all banks will become “ltd”. E.g. Punjab national bank=> Punjab national bank ltd.

Implications?
-BIC will have the voting powers to appoint Board of directors and other policy decision during AGM of shareholders.
-Government will sign an agreement with BIC, promising the autonomy. (that we’re majority shareholders in BIC, but we won’t interfere In your work- when you select directors, CMDs for those subsidiary banks.)
-This is not an entirely new concept. In UK, Government has setup UKFI (UK Financial investment ltd.) for the same purpose.

Reform #3: Temporary “BBB”
When Bank investment company (BIC) will own >50% shares in those Sarkaari banks, it’ll have the power to appoint Board of directors (And via them appoint the CMD).
But this requires repealing some acts = time consuming exercise because parliament sessions are not held 24/7/365.
But, we can’t wait that long, because Syndicate bank scam requires quick reform.
Therefore, Nayak recommends following temporary solution:

-Until BIC is born, Government should setup a Bank Boards Bureau (BBB) at Mumbai.
-This BBB will be madeup of Senior bankers. (3 members + 1 chairman; 3 years tenure)
-They’ll advice on all board appointment, bank chairman/CMD and Executive directors.
-Once BIC is setup, this BBB will be dissolved.

Misc. Reform #2: Private shareholding
At present: an individual person/Mutual fund etc. cannot own more than 5% shares in a Sarkaari bank. (At maximum 10%- after RBI permission).
Nayak proposes following reforms:
Increase the shareholding limits (figures not important)
category	permitted shareholding in bank
all financial institutions	
upto 10%
New category: Authorised Bank Investors (ABI). It’ll include pension funds, mutual funds, ETF etc. approved by RBI	
15% if he is board member
20% if he is not a board member

pro recommendaiton arguments
#1 Chariman and MD appointment
-Chairman’s pay not linked with profitability. [In private it is linked]
-He is appointed not for his talent but because he is in the “good books” of Government.
-He is not as ‘blood-thirsty’ for profit, like a private bank’s chairman.

#2: CVC-CAG-Risk aversion
Private banks: only RBI supervision. They don’t fall under purview of CVC-CAG-RTI.
-sarkari = govt share >50% so open to RTI,CAG and CVC so bank official dont take bold decisions.
Therefore, Nayak’s recommendation govt share should reduce below 50%

#3: Fiscal repression and Profitability
1private banks
-They reinvest profit in branch expansion, advertisement etc,very less in G-SEc as its return very ewss around 8%.

-Sarkaari banks
-They have invest profit in G-sec. (Government securities) as govt compel them.so less profit
-Same is done with LIC, EPFO and other institutions, where Government is majority shareholder.
Economic survey calls this phenomenon “fiscal repression”.

To stop this nuisance of “fiscal repression”, it is necessary that Government holds <50% shares in any Banks.

#4: Bailouts
Earlier, Government had forced Sarkaari banks to use their money to bailout loss making UTI and IDBI.
Sarkaari banks forced to give cheap loans to FCI, so that FCI can purchase foodgrains at a high Minimum support price (MSP)- to keep the farmer-votebank happy.
Sarkaari banks forced to “waive” debts of farmers before election.
While all this may sound good to votebank and socialism but in the long term it harms the system at large.

UTI-IDBI became complacent that even if we mismanage, they’ll bail us out. (Same goes with AirIndia).
Farmers don’t cultivate pulses, oilseeds or vegetables. But only wheat and rice because FCI is paying them large MSP. Result: veggie-shortage and food inflation.
Farmers don’t repay loans on time, hoping Government will waive their debts just before elections.
Again, to stop such nuisance, it is necessary that Government holds <50% shares in any Banks.

Nayak Anti-arguments
that Nayak recommendations must not be implemented AND Government must continue holding >50% shareholding in the Sarkaari banks because

Subprime crisis, LIBOR scam, Global financial meltdown: all this happened because of MNC-Banks and financial conglomerates outside Government control.
Only 40,000 out of 6 lakh villages, have bank branches. If Nayak recommendations accepted then all banks will run only with ‘profit-motive’, no one will setup branches in villages. Then, financial inclusion can’t be achieved.
Counter argument: RBI rule requires all banks to setup 25% of branches in rural areas
If CVC-CAG oversight is gone, it is possible these banks will connive with corporate borrowers and money laundering. (Recall the cobra post sting on ICICI etc. private banks)

->T2: FM wants 52% shareholding in banks
As per the Bank nationalization acts, Government shareholding must not fall below 51% in Sarkaari (Public sector) banks.



2010	Government decided- its minimum shareholding in any public sector bank, must not fall below 58%
2014, September	Finance ministry has sent a proposal to cabinet- to reduce shareholding to 52%. implications
Government gets money by selling excess shares=helps filling up the fiscal deficit pothole.
Government may give back that money to Sarkaari banks as ‘capital’ to meet the capital requirements BASEL-3 norms.

->T3: Gopalkrishna Committee on “Capacity building”
Who is G.Gopalkrishna?

Earlier he was Executive director of RBI. HE couldn’t get promotion to Dy.Governor post, so resigned.

What’s Purpose of his Committee?

RBI setup this Committee for ‘Capacity building in banks and non-banks’.

Gist of the matter?

PJ Nayak= improve efficiency via reforms in Government shareholding and board of directors.
But what about reforms at “field” level? What about transparency-bank loan scandals, issues in recruitment-transfer-appointment process?
Therefore, Rajanbhai had appointed G.Gopalkrishna Committee
Sep 2014: Committee submitted report
Dec 2014: likely to be implemented.
Let’s check its major recommendations:

Reform #1: Recruitment
Common Bank aptitude test (BAT)
Should be conducted online
BAT score should be used for for entry-level recruitments in banks.

Reform #2: Training
Each bank should have a “chief leaning officer”. He’ll provide coaching-mentoring in leadership Development.
Top management in public sector banks are close to retirement and risk-averse. These banks need younger people, lateral entry and diversification
NIBM, IIBF, CAFRAL etc. should provide specialized training for foreign exchange rules, treasury Management, online security etc.
Banks should send staff to deputation in institutes, or even abroad- to enhance their skills.

Reform #3: Staff-Transfer
in Sarkaari banks there is shortage of manpower at mid-executive level because talented officers leave to join private banks and NBFCs.
Syndicate bank loan scam.
Ex-CJI Sathasivam also complained the same- short tenure not sufficient to bring large scale reforms- in judiciary.
In this backdrop, bank-transfer policy indeed needs to be revamped. Gopalkrishna recommends that:

Bank should not transfer staff in a mechanical manner.
Transfer should be done to provide good leaders across geography.
Posts that have high concentration of power- the transfer should be done on need-basis rather putting fixed-terms on it.



US interest rate increase effect
-Us economy improving so high chance of interest rate increase
->FActor making indian economy robust from global influence
-measures like encouraging investment in long term debt instead of short term debt
-large forex reserve.
-Strict market norms by independent regulators
-Controlled CAD

->We have strong fundamentals but private sector posses a risk to our economy
-External commercial borrowing cost will increase
-FII /FDI flow will decrease
-This increase in capital interests will cause cost-push inflation and decrease employment further because of erosion of profits.
