14 Finance commision recommenation
-Inrease state share from central revenue to 42% against existing 32%
-In understanding the States’ expenditure needs will consider complete expenditure ignoring 
planned and no plan distintion.
-Minimize the centre discretion power for fund allocation.Grants based on 2011 population data
-Less bounds of funds to Central sponser scehem -> for financial autonomy
-More say of states in implenting central sponsered schemed -> tailor made as per their need.
-Divide states grants -> panchayat and muncipal corp
-Divide grant into - basic grant +  performance one for gram panchayats and municipal bodies
-The ration of basic to performance grant is 90:10 for panchayats; and 80:20 for municipalities
-Will help to do away with one size fit all approach
Criticism
-no clear direction on how to evaluate performance of Panchayats.so arbitrary -> nepotism
-net aggregate transfers from the Union to states would remain roughly same around 58-60%  as currently
-how will states plan and determine their regional needs and allocate funds based on them is a concern.

->14 finance commission Problem with tranferring fund to local bodies by finance comm
The issue of poor financial devolution to local government in hindering their effective functioning is well known. But theFinance Commissions, a constitutional body, charged with maintaining the fiscal federalism has certain limitations before augmenting the finances of local bodies.
-Under 73rd and 74th amendments, State Finance Commissions (SFCs) have been created to discharge the constitutional responsibility of suggesting ways to augment the local government resources. Thus FCs don’t have jurisdiction over here.
-Local governance, being a state subject, a body appointed by union government generally stays away from this subjects.
-But many states have constituted SFCs in regular interval and recommendations of many SFCs are not up to date.
-Many states have imposed stringent conditionalities for devolution of fund with the notable exception of kerala.
-The lack of political will is main reason.
-Proper auditing by CAG not followed in all states
Despite many legal handicaps, the FFC has tried its best to ameliorate the situation a bit. Steps taken by FFC:
-Working of SFCs were examined in depth and supported SFC responsiblity of taking care of local finance.
-After holding wide consultation with representatives of local bodies, recommended not to impose any further condition either by union or state government
-Although no formula was devised for vertical and horizontal distribution of fund, it broadly endorsed the line taken by Thirteenth Finance Commission (TFC)
-New measures to augment local government resources were suggested such as municipal bonds.
-Divide states grants -> panchayat and muncipal corp
-Performance based grant pattern (see above for details)



RBI systemically important bank declaraion
-in 2011move by Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) for Global systemically important (G-SIB) banks ,to avoid any 2011 like situation
-asked member country to declare Domestic -SIB
-given to banks with large share in banking whose risk can effect economy badly
-so rbi declared SBI and ICICI as so.their CAR as per BAsel 3 is 12 and 17% respecively
-done as a  framework to reduce the risks of failure of these SIBs in addition to the Basel III norms.
-RBI will designating them in August every year
implication
-more RBI secrutiny on these bank
-have to go streingent assesment while giving loan to avoid band loan
-CAR have to be maintained at upper end of the range
-credibility will increase -> more investment and more customer

-face issue in expansion

centre state budget segregation
-Article 112 of the Constitution deals with the budget also called the Annual Financial statement.
=centre
-policy from national perspective. 
-set tone of state budget as state depends on centre for many funds
-set up industry policy of nation
-control on income tax , domestric products through excise duty
-control foreign products through counter veiling duty (CVD) control.
-foreign technology through FDI limits and sector open to it.

It gives three sets of figures:

(a)	Actual figures for the preceding year
(b)	Revised estimates for the current year
(c)	Budget estimates for the coming year

The Budget in India is divided into two parts namely
1.	Revenue Budget
2.	Capital Budget

-When govt spend more than receipt it is said to be in Defecit.
-Defecit is taken care take by borrowing money which leads to the debt.

 -Government debt as a percent of GDP is used by investors to measure a country ability to make future payments on its debt,
 -thus affecting the country borrowing costs and government bond yields.

=states
-more social oriented than industry
-focus on social welfare like health , edu , sanitation ,drinking water
-land and agriculture are major economic activities

->Centrally sponsored schemes have also encroached in state area of policy making

Budget 2014 - Gold monetisation scheme.
The recent budget announced following 
(a). Gold Monetisation Scheme: where people can earn interest or take loan by
 depositing their gold.
	-People will deposit the gold and banks will issue certificates in leiu of that. That gold will be minted and provided to jwellers.
	-customer will earn interest and gold saving account will be opened by bank for him.
	-interest will be in terms of gold.say if 1% interest and deposit is 100 gram so after one year he will get value of 101 gram of gold. rate left to banks.


 (b). Sovereign Gold Bond : which is a paper-replica of metal gold. One can buy
 this and earn interest rate and redeem at market price of gold.
 (c). Indian government minting its own gold coin to decrease imports especially.
 
 
 MUDRA Bank
-stands for Micro Unit Development Refinance Agency
-Under govt motto of Funding the unfunded
-Specialed banks to give loans to MSME with special pref to SC/ST entrepreneur(60% owned by SC/ST/OBC)
-MSME don't have any formal channel of funding as bank don't give loan as they don't
have anything to guarntee
-Will boost MSME which generate millions of job and backbone of indian economy.
-Will push Make in india through MSME
-Will help to tap traditional knowledge through MSME.



countervailing duties (CVD) and special additional duties (SAD)
-Equivalent to tax such as excise duty (levied on domestic products) and can be applied 
on imports to give a level playing field to domestic manufacturers
-But govt exempted many imports from CVD and SAD terming it as consumer welfare.
=Disadvantages 
-Make domestic products costly compared to imports
- making unfair competition between foreign and domestic products
-deter domestic entrepreneurship in manufacturing.exa - some products dont have even single manufacturer.
-Hit govt on growth as well coz it hamper indigenousness of that product/technology
-Revenue loss to govt.
=Criticism
-Might hamper foreign investment in some critical sector
-Hence less GDP growth and job loses.
-Leving CVD might go against WTO principles of zero governmetn intervention.
Solutions:
-Should be replaced by uniform tax GST as it will be applicable to imports as well.
-Will also increase revenue by boarding the tax base.

Note: Various duties like Octroi state taxes are imposed on Domestic buyers which are not 
on foreign counterparts [ besides CVDs]

--4 may
New Note: Various duties like Octroi state salte taxes are imposed on Domestic products which are not on foreign counterparts [ besides CVDs]
-eliminating cvd structure also causing domestic entities to just buy from foreign and sell it here without any knowledge transfer , jobs, employment 
-eliminating both the excise duty and CVD, the domestic products still costs higher because of input taxes in domestic manufacturing which is not there in case zero-rated imported goods,




Employment elasticity 
Employment elasticity is the growth of employment relative to growth of Economy. %age of 
growth in employment against 1% increase in GDP
-Was higher in pre reform era coz 
->Almost neligible service sector
->Major population in labour intensive agri(less machine use)
->Ma
Post reform
- declined from 0.44 in  1999–2000 to 2004–05, to as low as 0.01 during second half  
2004–05 to 2009–10
-Negative elasticity in manufac and agri during 2nd half of decade
-Service sector was open many shifted from agree to services (banking, financial sector, BPO,internet)
-But growth in population and urbanization lead to less rise in employment->stagnation in employment
 growth
-Service is less labour intensive so low elasticity.
-Less elasticity in manufacturing coz modern manufacturing is capital goods intensive
-_ve in agri coz of more machines use and movement of people from agri to other sector

-G.N Bajpai recommendation on National Pension Scheme
-pensioner, receiving a little extra tham the prefixed amount and government, utilizing its stored fund for more holistic and overall development.
-1. The pension fund investment must be liberalized so that the pensioner has the provision of investing it in other options and not limited by one.current approach prescribes the limits for investment in certain assets that are perceived by the regulator to be risky

2. It also mentions that the government fund must be handled and taken care of by the private manager. Currently only public sector pension fund managers are allowed to manage the government NPS funds
3. The investing rules and regulations must be eventually be same for both private and government.This will allow the government NPS scheme a higher exposure to equity of up to 50%.
4. This may be implemented in six years to come after proper 'wait and watch' scrutiny.
-report has recommended bringing all the pension products under the purview of the PFRDA, noting that Sebi and the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India continue to grant approval to such products.





EU/US approach to tackle 2008 like crisis
-US recovering but Euro Zone (EZ) still 10% below where it should have been by now
-performing worst recovery comparing to greate eco crisis in 1930
-US took the Old macroeconomic model that is Keynesian way , which ask that in order to increase the employment , and fight depression , Lowering inflation , and infusing money , Boosting the demand and deficit spending [ Spending beyond pocket ] . This caused policy of quantitative easening or Cheap money , low interest money . This proved sound and successful if one connects the dots from now in 2015 to 2008 . unemployment is low , Growth is taking upward curve vis a vis EU condition

EU way of dealing 2008 crisis - It took new innovative approaches, which were based on principles of spending cuts , reducing govt spending , austerity measure . Such was based on principle that austerity will drive confidence which will spurn growth . However none happened and EU now is taking similar approach which US did the then. that is old macroeconomic Keynesian path of deficit spending

Lesson to India
~ Tight monetary policy in low growth environment can actually decreased confidence
~ Deficit financing is good but for investment /capital investment and not for consumption to Housing /infrastructure bubble as in Case of China or US [ before depression]
~ Loans to those sector which can actually have ability to repay in order to avoid recession rather curing it 
~ Regulation of financial sector to avoid such mishap . BN krishna Unified single regulator and consensus among regulator can be used

Govt Allow NRI,OCI,PIO foreign investmen as Domestic
-So far, investments by NRIs in only the aviation industry were excluded 
from the FDI limit of 49%; NRIs were permitted full ownership in the 
sector. 

The government has recently decided to treat foreign investments made by the NRIs, OCIs and PIOs, under Schedule IV of FEMA 1999 on a non-repatriable basis, at par with domestic investments made by Indian residents. This decision has been taken on account of the following reasons:
(A) It falls in line with a series of similarly placed reforms, which have been undertaken with the objective of encouraging the inflow of FDI esp in manufacturing sector.
(B) It would allow for greater assimilation of the NRIs, OCIs and PIOs with India's growth story. it will also reaffirm the role of this constituency in projecting India's soft power.

While the impact of this move cannot be gauged precisely, it is likely to have the following implications for the Indian economy:
(A) Increased investment across sectors and greater inflow of foreign exchange remittance, thereby leading to economic growth of the country;
(B) As the investment will be on a non-repatriable basis, the FDI would be of a permanent nature. This will translate into greater stability for the economy, besides creating a revolving fund for investment because the amount once invested would not be eligible for repatriation outside India. 
(C) As the NRIs, OCIs and PIOs will now will be consider as domestic investment and they will not be subjected to the FDI ceilings, this decision will allow space to be vacated by them on the FDI landscape, which can then be filled by foreign investors.
-As investment will be made in Indian rupess so will save Rupee from exchange rate volatality.
-Such flow will generate a positive vibe in international market attracting further investment from other strata observing the growth and positivity
-expected to spur Foreign exchange remittance

->Imprtance
-recently opening up of various economic sectors including insurance, defence and railways to FDI
-Sept 15 india become top FDI destination a head of US,China etc.

=FDI role in eradication hunger, poverty etc
->Positive role
-will help to remove finance constraint -> so more money to spend to welfare prog
-Will help to reduce import bill -> like defnece manufacutring locally -> less CAD -> more leg room to spend 
-FDI in infra will boost economy -> more taxes with govt -> more money to spend
-Will help in TOT which will increase productivity . Fxamp FDI in food processing will lead to less wastage of food -> more money with farmer -> more products -> low inflation
-boost compitition -> desi org more efficent
-FDI played crucial role in proverty reduction in China

Critics
-Main motto of FDI is to earn handsome return not social welfare
-increase economy volatility to global eco crisis
-Increase govt debt which might not be good in long term.
-benefits only limited strata of society exa Richer.
-have failed for many section ,exa : insurance cap for FDI raised but still many people are not insured.
-Despite 100% FDI being allowed in the pharmaceutical sector, the costs of medicines continues to increase and takes away a large chunk from household savings

Way farword
-it influence and can really help if policy reform happen as merely opening up sector for FDI not sufficent solely
- latest urgency on the part of the government should be to launch GST, Labour reforms, bankruptcy 
bill
-We can learn from nation (like China) which has been able to reduce poverty .


Fed rate effect on India and world
-The US Federal Reserve reduced the interest rate to near 0 levels to stimulate the investment and the overall economy post 2008 sub prime crisis
-Sept 2015 considering the global economy scenario US fed kept rates unchanged which is close to 0. around 0.25% (?)
--World economy already in crunch due to liquidity tightening & demand contractio due to china currency issue , low oil  and commodity price ,quantitative easing (QE) exit by the US a year ago and the rising fiscal austerity in recent years in the major Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development economies.

Why US is raising interest rate now?
1. The US economy is out of the recession, and is growing steadily at around 2-3%
2. Unemployment figures are at a record low
3. The artificial low interest rates has plunged US into greater debts
4. with easy liquidity policy there is a danger of increase in inflation.

->Impact has it been increased 
1. As, US interest rate rises, foreign investors (FIIs ) will flock to the US to garner better returns in America
2. As a consequence, rupees will depreciate further, causing political chaos and making import costly
3. Economically, depreciation will lead to greater inflations.
4. Also, as the investors take their money out, liquidity in the country will decrease. This could further suppress the already low levels of investment. 
5. Further business sentiments could go down, harming the Make In India program
-Unhedged borrowing could potentially increase the debt burden of several corporates as fed rate hike could be accompanied with sharp currency volatility.
6. On the positive side, depreciation will boost Indian exports.

->Why india better positioned then other emerging economy (EM)
-Strong economic fundamental
-govt resolve for reforms like increasing ease of doing business , make in india campaign, one stop clerance ,liberal FDI policy
-RBI has big forex reserve to meet any short term volatility with rupee depreciation or balance of payment
-huge domestic spending
-increasing saving rate owing to sharp decline in oil prices and lift of sanction from Iran
-Govt is proposed to spend huge amount in infra development which will stimulate spending and eco growth.
-India banking not much exposed to unhedged foreign borrowing.

->India will not be much effected is wrong assumption
- even though we have huge forex reserve in dollar but china coudn't avoid recent turmoil even after having huge @3.5 trillion reserve.Thus, India will need to be prepared to lose substantial reserves if it plans to defend the rupee through foreign exchange interventions 
-decrease in oil price and removing iran sanction has reduce inflation and more income with household but it has not be compensated by rise in demand to keep the spending figure uneffected.


way forward
-Match the match the rise in US interest rates by raising domestic interest rates — a possibility that is not even on the radar of either the market or India’s policymakers.
-India policymaker should wait and watch til the things become clear
-with low inflation ,cutting interest rate will boost both spending and investment 
-govt can pass on price decline to consumer raterh than taking it away by taxing this will left more money with household to spend and accelerate economy further.

-Us labour productivity is subdue and should go up for eco growth 
-to increase that wage hike might happen -> inflation -> fed has to increase rate


25 per cent of the country’s exports are destined for commodity-exporting countries (West Asia, Russia and Latin America), all of which have been severely affected by the China slowdown 




GDP v/s GVA

--The Gross Value Added (GVA) and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) give a picture of economic activity from producers (supply side) and consumers (demand side) perspectives respectively.
--GDP is essentially GVA plus net indirect taxes [NIA] (indirect taxes minus subsidies) 
- divergence due to presence of Net Indirect Taxes ( NIT= indirect taxes-subsidies) which are accounted in GDP at market price calculations (GDP is sum of GVA and NIT). 
-GDP when comaring to world (ie. eco overall picture) ,GVA to measure sectoral performance.

GVA is better  because.
- A sector-wise breakdown provided by the GVA measure can better help the policymakers to decide which sectors need incentives/ stimulus or vice versa.
-better productivity of the producers as it excludes the indirect taxes .However, it can also be argued that GVA is distorted due to presence of subsidies.
-GDP can increase when inflation goes up or taxes goes up without actually increasing output not so with GVA


-Goldilocks economy 
A Goldilocks economy is one that is neither too aggressive nor too defensive.
- It stays within stipulated limits of inflation and is condusive to moderate growth. 
-The monetary policy in such economy tends to be a balanced one, i.e. neither too high interest rates that they deter industrial expansion, nor ultra low so as to boost up inflation.
- The phrase has been derived from a children’s story and was first used in economics in 1992.
Recently, the RBI has termed the scenario in India as one resembling the features of a Goldilocks Economy. Following are the reasons why it can be so termed:
-We are growing with a moderate growth rate of around 7%
a) The inflation rate – both wholesale and retail – continue to be under control at least for 2 quarters.it is hovering around~ 5%, well within the 6% range.
b) CAD below the target of 4.1%. However, it is also hindering public investment at a time when the private sector is looking to the government to spend and boost demand.
-Share market showing growth with strong basics
- Credit rating agencies like CRISIL, Moody’s, Standard and Poors rating is Stable
->challenges
-no scope for complacency as prospects of a weak monsoon, coupled with increasing crude prices can push inflation higher soon.
- capacity utilization for the industry @ 70% is far from optimum, thus negating any meaningful employment expansion.


Grecee Crisis {Capital athens}
-Become first nation to default on IMF repayment
-Citizen voting no for EU bailout terms has worsen the situation,EU has put following conditions for bailout
	-Substantial cut by greece govt in public expenditure like salary ,persion,social schemes 
	-Reforms to liberalise the economy

Effect on India
_ve effects
-investor will move out from Greece -> dollar strong ->rupee weak ->costly import
-Can hit our It services
-Indian corporate investment will go for a toss
-Euro might be weaken so can effect our trade with europe and euro is used to calculate SDR and that will decrease, indian foreign exchange reserves could come down
-As euro value decreases, it's export potential increases. A high export potential will attract investment. A potential outflow from indian market can happen 
-A sudden withdrawal from indian markets can destabilise our economy and rupee may tumble.
+ve effects
-Since Euro as a currency may become unstable due to fear of spillover effect on Italy, Portugal etc. investors may look for alternative stable economies, India is this sense could benefit
-if rupee depreciate our export will become more attractive

Effect on Europe and its countereffects on India
-Default would mean a huge loss to europe central back ,euro will come down to make it attractive interest rate will increase -> will effect  investment in our market
-our IT services and export may take a hit
-Volatile stock market due to heavy speculation would hurt investors in the short-run
-greeceexit give negative message that euro membership is reversible and shore up further anti-euro movements and thus resulting in a vicious cycle

Should we worry
-Strong macroeconomics fundamentals.
-No , our ecomony not that much linked to greece
-High foreign reserve
-Better prepare to tackle such crisis.
-US Fed might not hike up rates immediately in the event of grexit and that would check flight of dollars.
