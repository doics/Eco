Corrolis force
- Coriolis effect is a deflection of moving objects when the motion is described relative to a rotating reference frame. 
-Newton's laws of motion describe the motion of an object in a (non-accelerating) inertial frame of reference. When Newton's laws are transformed to a uniformly rotating frame of reference, the Coriolis and centrifugal forces appear. Both forces are proportional to the mass of the object. 
-The Coriolis force is proportional to the rotation rate of object and the centrifugal force is proportional to its square.
- The Coriolis force acts in a direction perpendicular to the rotation axis and to the velocity of the body in the rotating frame and is proportional to the object's speed 
-The centrifugal force acts outwards in the radial direction and is proportional to the distance of the body from the axis of the rotating frame. 
-These additional forces are termed inertial forces, fictitious forces or pseudo forces.[1] 
-They allow the application of Newton's laws to a rotating system.
-they  do not exist in a non-accelerating or inertial reference frame.
W.R.T earth
 -The Coriolis effect is caused by the rotation of the Earth and the inertia of the mass experiencing the effect. 
 -Because the Earth completes only one rotation per day, the Coriolis force is quite small, 
 -its effects  become noticeable only for motions occurring over large distances and long periods of time, such as large-scale movement of air in the atmosphere or water in the ocean. 
 -Such motions are constrained by the surface of the earth, so only the horizontal component of the Coriolis force is generally important. 
 -This force causes moving objects on the surface of the Earth to be deflected to the right (with respect to the direction of travel) in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere. 
 -The horizontal deflection effect is greater near the poles and smallest at the equator, since the rate of change in the diameter of the circles of latitude when travelling north or south, increases the closer the object is to the poles.[2] 
 -Rather than flowing directly from areas of high pressure to low pressure, as they would in a non-rotating system, winds and currents tend to flow to the right of this direction north of the equator and to the left of this direction south of it.
- This effect is responsible for the rotation of large cyclones 

Effects
-one of factor for tropical cyclone formation
-one of factors for creation of polar vortex conditions in Northern & Southern Hemisphere
-alter direction of ocean currents


->-Tropicla cyclone
Tropical cyclone is a weather phenomenon,which is confined to the tropics only.The naming of these cyclones are necessary and there is a particular standard approach to name these cyclone to spread awareness for security purpose in order to check maximum disaster from these cyclone.
parameters to name the tropical cyclone-
WMO has created five regional tropical cyclone bodies for naming the cyclones in the tropical regions of pacific,atlantic and the Indian ocean.The naming should be focused upon the parameters-
1-Names are generally used in alphabetical order from the list of the  names given by the assigned countries.(?)
2-name should be familiar to local people to understand and remember the cyclone so as to facilitate tropical cyclone disaster risk awareness ,preparedness,management,and reduction.
3-Different names to be selected to avoid confusion arising out of the creation of different cyclone at the same time in same ocean basin.
Similarly,in the north indian ocean ,eight countries such as India,sri lanka,bangladesh,oman,maldives,myanmmar, thailand, and pakistan are assigned to name these cyclones originating in Arabian sea, and Bay of bengal.Some of the tropical Cyclones named by these countries are Nilofer by pakistan,Asobaa by sri lanka,Hud hud by oman etc.

causes origin of cyclone in Arabian sea.-
1.Arabian sea being a closed sea and small in size poses perfect conditions for a tropical cyclone to be formed.
2.Temperature of Arabian sea ranges between 27 -30 deg.c due to direct fall of sun rays.
3.It is located between 8-20 deg. latitude.
-High relative humidity which helps condensation of water vapour into water droplets and clouds and release heat energy
-atmospheric instability which helps in formation clouds with condensation of rising rising air over ocean
-location 4-5 latitude degree from equator allows influence the forces due to earth rotation
-Mature tropical cyclone--spiral pattern of highly turblent cumulus clouds which are accompanied by winds up to 250 kmph.
-decay process--if central low pressure is weaken due to source of moist air being abruptly cut off the cyclone start decaying
Nature of Tropical cyclone in Arabian sea-
-Tropical cyclone are intense low pressure confined to 30 degree north to 30 degree south latitude in the atmosphere
>since tropical cyclone moves east to west,Cyclones formed in it do not make landfall over India.
>due to swift movement,it is difficult to predict its path.
>quickly dissipate after coming on land.



->Desert formation reasons
->Geographical
-Mountains:
Rain-shadow also produce Deserts.
Exa: Gobi Desert north of the Himalayas 
absence of mountain to cause orohraphic rain is also a cuase.exa Aravali so Thar deser.
Trade winds:
Most  lie in a belt 20-40 degree N/S of the equator  on the western side of the continents. 
-This sweeped by the trade winds, which originate from the east.So most rain on eastern part
and western part receive only dry trade winds
-trade winds blow offshore rise from equator when descent at tropic it has little moisture.
Cold current
-these currents produce a desiccating effect, due to which a high pressure region
 is created in the region, which further accelerates the desert formation.
 exa :Atacama desert, Sahara Desert, Californian desert,great Australian desert.
Cold Air:
Near the poles, no sunlight , no evaporation , no rain. Antarctica can be called biggest desert of the world.
-Man made
-you know it :)

->Earthquake

-Measure technique
Magnitude of an earthquake is determined based on measuring the earth movement with time using seismographs. The readings obtained helps in determining the energy released
location of epicentre of an earthquake and is expressed as reading on various
scales
-Richter scale developed by Charles Richter in 1935 is one of the most popular 
- logarithmic scale with base 10 from 0 to 10, readings are based on maximum
seismic wave amplitude recorded on seismograph

-intensity
-the effects of earthquake on building structures, human perceptions and nature
-In general, intensity is maximum near epicentre and decreases with increase in distance
-scale used in US to measure intensity is Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) Scale. This scale has 12 levels from no damage to total destruction and designated by roman numbers.it does not have a mathematical basis and only based on the ranking of observed effects

New Techniques: 1) Moment magnitude scale (Mw): It is based on the amount of displacement
occurred along a fault zone rather than ground motion. This is most common scale now to measure earthquake

-Japan Meteorological Agency seismic intensity scale (JMA): The unit of scale is "Shindo” and features are
same as MMI with only difference is that JMA measures intensity from 0 to 7 unlike
MMI.JMA is world's fastest intensity information technology. Seismic
intensity meters have been installed throughout the country, making calculation
much faster. The initial estimation comes in 1.5 minutes and after a few
seconds; a warning is issued to the general public on TV.
-ShakeMaps: - A ShakeMap is a representation of ground shaking produced by an
earthquake in real-time. This map makes it easier to relate the recorded
ground shaking to the expected felt and damage distribution. This helps
in creating intensity maps to access the damage occurred

Why Himalya prone to earthquakes
-Due to origin of Himalya
-Himalayas are formed by the subduction of Indian plate under the Eurasian plate and is increasing in its size till today as the plates are moving.
-This subduction zone creates strain under the region which is released at frequent intervals and is responsible for earthquakes.
-
Nature of earthquakes
-Himalayas being folded mountains, the nature of these earthquakes are for most of them the focus at shallow depth
-the time gap between body waves and surface waves also will be less with shallow depth of focus, raising the damage levels.
- responsible for massive damages, further the terrain being uneven and human settlements along them increases the vulnerability

->why earth shake during it
-plate tectonics -  The release of energy occurs along a fault. A fault is a sharp break in the crustal rocks.Rocks along a fault tend to move in opposite
directions. As the overlying rock strata press them, the friction locks them together. However, their tendency to move apart at some point of time overcomes the friction
-faulting and slip stick effect: under the earth many vertical and horizontal pressures acts.This cause fractures at the weak point.As per stick slip effect when tensile force acts on rocks ,rocks stretches under it till it reaches its elasticity and beyond that it breaks into pieces and tries to get back to its original position. This creates disequilibrium in earths's crust and produces tremors.

Earthquake is caused by the sudden release of energy through the sliding friction of plates that transmits waves in all directions.
-	This release of energy occurs along a fault
-	The joints of the plates gets locked in due to friction and their opposite movements
-	Due to intense compression force, the friction is broken which allows the plates to slide past each other releasing energy
-	This energy transmits body waves which travels in all directions through the body of the earth
-	The body waves interact with surface rocks and become surface waves causing vibration and thereby the shaking.



->Eastern West Himalya Flora diff
-East more tain so evergreen  coniferous tree.
-East more humidity so tree leaves are broad and more flora variation
-eastern Himalaya is more complex structurally ans soil is highly erode,western part is 
having karewa deposits.so we see saffron agri and flower valley in west.
-the snow line in the western Himalayas in lower than the eastern (coz of latitude) alpine 
shrubs occur at relatively lower height

->Himalya and Decan river system
-both are different in evolution due to geological diff in both regions , climate diff and time diff in their formation.
-Himalya river comparatively young than Decan one.
-perennial v/s seasonal
-decan less deep as decan made of hard rocks whereas Himalya rocks are softer and easier erodeable.
-Himalya river show more topography like V shapped valley ,George and meanders etc
-

->indian ocean dipole (IOD)
-Two of these main factors effecting Indian monsoon are El-Nino and INDIAN OCEAN DIPOLE..
El-Nino is having a notorious image as it is considered as enemy of plenty monsoon rainfall however 

every El-Nino does not hinder the monsoon rainfall it depends upon the intensity of heating of 

eastern and central pacific ocean as well as on IOD. 
IOD is an irregular oscillation of sea surface temperature in which western indian ocean becomes 

alternatively warmer/colder than the eastern part of ocean.
IOD is of two types 
1)POSITIVE IOD when western indian ocean becomes warmer than the eastern part. It is a beneficial 

condition for proper monsoon and this condition also help in reducing the impact of El-Nino.
During positive IOD, there is enhanced cloud formation and rainfall in western part of equatorial 

ocean near african coast while such activity is suppressed near sumatra therefore this condition 

becomes positive for India. eg in El-Nino years 1983, 1994,1997 india got surplus or normal 

rainfall.
2) negative IOD in this situation eastern part of indian ocean becomes warmer than western part and 

help El-Nino in negatively impacting the monsoon rainfall.
Under this condition sumatran and indonesian coast get more rainfall that retards the rains over 

India.
When negative IOD and El-Nino come together it becomes the reason of deficit rainfall in india and 

other countries depending upon monsoon e.g in 1992 this condition gave rise to deficient rainfall.
Therefore IOD has a special impact on India's monsoon as rainfall does not only depend upon the El-

Nino effect but also get sufficient or deficient rainfall due to combination of these two 

phenomenons.

->Karst Region
-is a landscape created by groundwater dissolving sedimentary rock such as limestone.
-can develop on several types of rocks, such as dolomite, gypsum, and salt.
Features
1)Karst region have bleak landscape usually broken by precipitous slopes.
2)general absence of surface drainage as most of the surface water has gone underground.
3)Limestone pavements:
these are one of the most intriguing feature of karst region,which is formed when solution
 of water and limestone enlarges cracks into trenches.
4)Swallow holes:-
They are also found on the surface of limestone ,which are small depressions carved out of solution 
where rain water sinks into limestone at point of weakness.
5)Diline:-
do line is another outstanding feature which is formed when no of swallow holes coalence a larger hollow.
6)Uvala:-
uvala is also found when several several dolina merge as a result of subsidence.
7)caves:-
streams descend through swallow holes to underground passages and the regions are honeycombed with caves.
8)stalactites,stalagmites,and pillars:-
These are underground feature that adorn the limestone caves.
*stalactites:-are sharp,slender and downward growing pinnacle that hang from cave root.
*stalagmites:-as moisture drips from the roof,it trickes down the stalactite and drop to floor where
 stalagmites are formed.
*pillars:-stalagmites and stalactites join together to form pillars.
Importance
-Caves are large enough survival of animals, forest dwellers.
-The karstified limestone acts as aquifers it contain huge amount of water, which can used during dry months. 
Example: Two million people in central Texas get their drinking water from the karst aquifer known as the Edwards Aquifer

->Lakes
-temporary features of the crust formed due to accumulation of water in hollows 
and are connected to rivers by outflows while percolation and evaporation happen as well
-Man made or natural
-Usage
-Transport + T as inland navigation routes. Example :The Great Lakes of North America.
-Fresh water , irrigation , recreational activities 
-fishing , salt + other minerals
- Power generation and water flow regulation like Bakhra nagal dam lake
-moderation of climate:impact like the oceans
environmental issues
-eutrophication  due to discharge of fertilizer water,Greate lake
-Untreated sewage, industrial effluents and trash from cities are dumped,
Powai water has been declared unfit for human consumption
-Tourism like oil from boats being operated in kerala backwaters
and pollution in Kashmir Dal lake.
-Acid rain come down into lakes as well
-Due to chemical in lake , fishing is effected. 


->Lightening 
Lightening is a major natural hazard just like floods and cyclones. However, due to its dispersed nature, it has escaped any serious consideration even while being responsible for around 10% of all deaths caused by natural hazards.

-Lightning is the means of dissipation of extra collected energy in the cumulous and nimbus clouds mainly.
Lightening is an electrostatic discharge during thunderstorms. Lightening generally strikes isolated trees, poles, standing buildings etc. A lightening strike can cause serious burns, mental disorientation and frequently death. Data by National Crime Records Bureau show that lightening has been responsible for more than 2000 deaths in India every year since 2005.

Lightening strikes are more common in the eastern states of the country like Odisha, West Bengal along with the North Eastern states. The Vidarbha and Marathawada regions of Maharashtra also have around 300 fatalities annually due to lightening strikes.

Lightening strikes have the following consequences -
1. Lead to serious injuries and death for a large number of people.
2. Causes economic losses as it can damage a lot of sensitive instruments.
3. Lightening can also start forest fires, thus further causing damange to life and property.

-should be declared as natural disaster so that people can get compensation.


->Erosion , tranportation and deposition by river w.r.t human
Adv
-creation of plains area which support high population density. Exa ganga plane
-Creation of productive alluvial soil which increase land fertility.Indus and Ganga plains
-enable farmer prosperity as more than one crop per year.AFter flood WB farmer
harvest 2 crops of rice
-Minerals and gases in river bed deposited by same process over year.
-Naturally remove alkanity and salinity of soil
-recreation scenic sports

dis
-siltation cause flood
-widening of river banks effect human settlement nearby
-soil erosion in upper river valley
-deposit of mud at dams create difficulties in electricity production
-Bring along harmful substances as well
-change of river course like Kosi in bihar
- health problems as flood is generally succeed by endemic .




->Soil creep,soil flow and land slide (mass movement)
-all 3 by different combinations of soil, water, topography and gravity results into
=land creep-
-slow and gradual/continous movement of soil over gentle slopes.
-it can happen even in the absence of water due to wind/ animal peddling.
-minimal water can act as lubricant in this process.
soil flow-
it a bit faster than land creep.
This occur when either slope is higher, moisture content is more or bedrock itselfs become unstable 
at times and slides leading to movement of soil fast and settling as huge mass at some point. 
It occurs with Soil creep situations only where moisture goes high or bed rock is smaller in size or blast/mining/dam construction.
it is visibly seen over weeks and months. even it can be observed over days/ hours immediately after the rains.
land slides-
it is a sudden fall of land mass due to acute slopes,gravitation force and lubricant action of water.
-possible due to other reasons also like quake and deforestation.
this is due to detachment of land mass over regolith where the water detaches the weak junctions
-Land slides are very rapid as compared to other two
-this cause heavy damage.
In India all the three forms are evident. soil creep and soil flow are common causes of soil erosion in India
happen all across india, through out the year. but as india gets nearly 75% of its rain during monsoons and western disturbances land slides are also not uncommon
-recent uttarakhand floods and pune land slides are examples for that.
Reasons:
1)In Western Ghats due to the presence of lateritic cap which is very sensitive to mass movements
2)Unscientific exploitation of the Himalayas, deforestation, and indiscriminate construction, mining ,complex geology,seismic activity, and heavy rainfall 
sol
Hazard mapping programme, environmentally sensitive techniques of construction,
-use of electronic distance meter measurements for measuring slope movements, 
-early warning systems could reduce the damage caused by these movements 
-Afforestation on a large scale 


->valley glaciers are relatively dynamic. they express both erosion and deposition. whereas continental ice sheets are relatively stable in their composition.
valley glaciers-
1. they are dynamic ,wide effect of temperature and water recycling.
2. water cycle rejuvenates their activity. 
3. they erode the soil in up stream and deposit them into moraine, boulder plains in the down stream
4. there is huge diversity in topography here. they include u shaped and hanging vallies. cirques, crevasses, bergschrunds, craig and tail, erratics, kettle lakes, morain depositional plains...... 
5. both altitude and latitude play an important role in forming them.
continental ice sheets-
1. they are thickly packed ice sheets.
2. they are a bit stable over glaciated forms.
3. erosion and depositional activities are a bit uncommon.
4. water cycle has limited role here.
5. latitude is the sole reason for the development of these sheets.
6. they are not much diverse
effect of climate change-
both glaciers and continental ice sheets are being effected by climate change. but the impact of climate change over glaciers is a bit severe due to their delicate design. even mild increase in temperatures can greatly effect the health of a glacier. melting down of glaciers have been being reported from different parts of the world. frequency of flash floods are are being reported in these systems. unfortunately 'much resistant' continental ice sheets are also melting over years due to climate change . hence this is high time to act upon


->Western Disturbances
-used to describe an extra-tropical storm that  brings sudden winter rain and snow
 to the northwestern parts of the Indian subcontinent
-This is a non-monsoonal precipitation pattern driven by the Westerlies.
Origination:
1. The moisture originates over the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean.
2. carry moisture usually in the upper atmosphere(unlike tropical storms where it is carried
 in the lower atmosphere so it travel larget distance).
3. In India, moisture is sometimes shed as rain after encounters with the Himalayas.
4. In the Himalayan region monsoon current progresses from east to west. But the WDs 
 from west to east, with consequent rise in pressure and cold pool of air in the rear.
-through out year , peak during winter months of January and February. Their effect is 
minimal during  the monsoon months in India.
Affects on Economy:
1. important to the development of the Rabi crop in the northern subcontinent,exa wheat. 
2. Their effect sometime extends up to Gangetic plains and Northeast India,
3.also responsible for snow fall in J&K,Himachal and Uttarakhand which supports 
its agri like apple etc.
4. But elongated effect like in current year can destroy cultivation and then govt 
compensating farmer
+ even leading to farmer suicide.
- have been linked to disasters. 
In this year hailstorm and rains in Gujarat, MP, UP and Rajasthan has caused severe damage
 to Cotton, Mango, Wheat and gram crops
-Such losses from disasters cost India about 2% if its GDP and may worsen if not addressed

Frequency increasing for western disturbance in recent time
-because of presence of easterlies from Bay of Bengal
-due to pronounced warming over the Tibetan plateau in recent decades which can be attributed to climatic warming,avours enhancement of meridianal temperature gradients
-warming in recent decades over west central Asia led to an increase in instability of the western winds thereby increasing WDs 
- Changes in Jet stream i.e. Upper tropical circulating air which separates cold temperate region from South Asia. Jet stream is most complex of phenomenon and it decides the depression and wind movement of the region.
